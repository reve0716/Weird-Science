####[__Theia__ - *The Mother of the Sun (**Helios**), the Moon(**Selene**) and the Dawn (**Eos**)*](http://www.greek-gods.org/titans/theia.php)

><p>There was once a Mars-sized planet called Theia orbiting in our solar system. The planet was named after the Greek Titan who gave birth to the Moon goddess Selene - a fitting name considering that the planet Theia is thought tobe responsible for the birth of our moon. In theory by crashing into Earth whichresulted in the creation of the "Moon".</p>
