####[__Theia__ - *The Mother of the Sun (**Helios**), the Moon(**Selene**) and the Dawn (**Eos**)*](http://www.greek-gods.org/titans/theia.php)

##<p>There was once a Mars-sized planet called Theia orbiting in our solar system. The planet was named after the Greek Titan who gave birth to the Moon goddess Selene '-' a fitting name considering that the planet Theia is thought to be responsible for the birth of our moon.
In theory by crashing into Earth which resulted in the creation of the __*"Moon"*__.</p>
